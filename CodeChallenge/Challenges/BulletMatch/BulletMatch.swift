Forensic specialists examine spent cartridges for unique
markings left by parts of a gun. They can then compare
these markings to a gun thought to used to fire the
original bullet.

Given two markings, one from a spent cartridge and the other
from a suspected weapon, both as Strings, return 1 if they match
and 0 if they don't.

EXAMPLES:
Match, returns 1
"| |||  |   |" and
"| |||  |   |"

Match, returns 1 though one is rotated. Bullets can be rotated.
Your solution should account for the possible rotation of bullets.
"|| ||| | " and
" | || |||"

Doesn't match, returns 0
"| |||  |   |" and
"||| |  |   |"
